Regret for the time wasted can become a power of good in the time that remains.

Task:
------
We deployed a Nginx and PHPFPM based setup on Kubernetes cluster last week and it had been working fine. This morning one of the team members made a change somewhere which caused some issues, and it stopped working. Please look into the issue and fix it:

The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. Figure out the issue and fix the same.

Once issue is fixed, copy /home/thor/index.php file from jump host into nginx-container under nginx document root and you should be able to access the website using Website button on top bar.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Resolution:
===========

  - kubectl get deploy -A

  -  kubectl get pods

  * configmap configuration

  - kubectl get configmap

  - kubectl get configmap nginx-config -o wide 

  -  kubectl get configmap nginx-config -o yaml

  * Copy the index.php in document root path as per the configmap

  - kubectl cp /home/thor/index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html -c nginx-container

  
  * The running pod document root mount path is not correct due to which we 
     unable to copy file 

  - kubectl get pod nginx-phpfpm -o yaml > /tmp/nginx.yaml

  - vi /tmp/nginx.yaml

  1-...
   "volumeMounts":[{"mountPath":"/var/www/html","name":"shared-files"}]} ....

  2-    f:subPath: {}
              k:{"mountPath":"/var/www/html"}:
                .: {}
                f:mountPath: 

  3- volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html    ====> /var/www/html
      name: shared-files
    - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount

  * Edit the yaml file and change document mount path /usr/share/nginx with /var/www at  3 locations

  - /usr/share/nginx with /var/www

  * kubectl replace -f /tmp/nginx.yaml --force

  - kubectl get pods

  - kubectl describe pod/nginx-phpfpm -n default


  - kubectl cp /home/thor/index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html -c nginx-container


  * To validate the task login on pod console and curl nginx port

    - kubectl exec -it nginx-phpfpm -c nginx-container --/bin/bash

    - curl http://localhost:8099
